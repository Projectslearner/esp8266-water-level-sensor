### ESP8266 Water Level Sensor Project

#### Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to use an ESP8266 microcontroller to monitor water levels using a water level sensor. Water level sensors are essential in various applications such as water tanks, irrigation systems, and industrial equipment where monitoring water levels is crucial.

#### Components Needed
- **ESP8266 Microcontroller**
- **Water Level Sensor**
- **Jumper Wires**
- **Breadboard**

#### Block diagram


#### Circuit Setup
1. **Connecting the Water Level Sensor to ESP8266:**
   - Connect the analog output pin of the water level sensor to analog pin A0 on the ESP8266.
   - Ensure a common ground (GND) connection between the ESP8266 and the water level sensor.

#### Instructions
1. **Setup:**
   - Initialize serial communication at a baud rate of 9600 for debugging purposes.

2. **Operation:**
   - In the `loop()` function:
     - Read the analog voltage from the water level sensor using `analogRead(waterLevelPin)`.
     - Convert the analog value to a percentage of water level using the `map()` function.
     - Print the water level percentage to the Serial Monitor.

3. **Considerations:**
   - **Sensor Calibration:** Calibrate the water level sensor according to the range and type of liquid being measured.
   - **Accuracy:** Ensure stable power supply and proper placement of the sensor for accurate readings.
   - **Deployment:** Securely mount the sensor in the water tank or system to maintain consistent measurements.

#### Applications
- **Water Management Systems:** Monitor water levels in tanks or reservoirs.
- **Irrigation Systems:** Control irrigation based on water level readings.
- **Industrial Applications:** Prevent overflow or ensure adequate water supply in industrial processes.

#### Notes
- **Analog Output:** The water level sensor provides an analog output that varies based on the water level, which is then mapped to a percentage for easier interpretation.
- **Serial Output:** Use the Serial Monitor to observe and debug water level sensor readings and operations.
